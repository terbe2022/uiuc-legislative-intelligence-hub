# UIUC Legislative Intelligence Platform

## AI-Powered Legislative Intelligence for Strategic University Decision Support

The Legislative Intelligence Platform transforms raw legislative text into structured, actionable intelligence to help the University of Illinois understand policy direction, emerging trends, and institutional impact.

This site serves as the central gateway to the platform’s tools, analytics, and ongoing development.

## How the Platform Works

The system follows an end-to-end analytical pipeline:

### 1. Data Ingestion
Legislative text is collected from external sources and standardized into a structured, queryable format.

### 2. Document Chunking
Bills are segmented into structured units to support retrieval and large-language-model processing.

### 3. AI-Based Feature Extraction
Large language models are used to extract structured attributes including:

- Legislative goals  
- Policy domains and subcategories  
- Intended beneficiaries  
- Institutional impact indicators  
- Ideological alignment  
- Impact ratings  

### 4. Scoring and Normalization
Extracted features are standardized into structured metadata to enable filtering, comparison, and analytics.

### 5. Interactive Exploration
Users access search tools, dashboards, and visualization components to explore legislative intelligence at scale.
